Python Review 3
===============

Continue with our context manager example
Import sys
Write some 'if' logic to check if additional sys.argv values have been provided
If so, use the first value, sys.argv[1] as the name of the file to use in the context manager
(Validate that sys,argv[1] s a non-emty string)
If no value exists in sys.argv[1] then use a default filename

NB remember you will ned to run this OUTSIDE VSCode, e.g
python review3.py file.txt newcontent

Next, check to see if there is a value for sys.argv[2] 
If there is, use that value as the text to be written into the file by the context manager
If not, use some default text

Then go back you review2. Import your context manager into that project
Use the context manager to direct the returned API text into a file
Don't worry about sys.argv, since your code will use defaults

Optional
--------
Write tests to prove your validation techniques and to prove the default values get used
